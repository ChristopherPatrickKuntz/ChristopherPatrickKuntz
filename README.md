## Independent Researcher & Systems Builder

I work at the intersection of research, systems design, and real-world operations.

My background spans high-stakes operational leadership, technical system architecture, and independent AI safety research. I specialize in turning loosely defined problems into stable, working systems that people can actually use and trust.

### Current Focus Areas

- AI safety and deployment integrity
- Communication-mode and intent misclassification
- Context-aware intent verification protocols
- Human-aligned guardrails that reduce over-intervention
- Systems that work without retraining or behavioral coercion

---

### Builder & Operations Background

Before focusing on independent research, I spent years designing and operating real systems in production environments:

- Led high-stakes operational teams in safety-critical infrastructure
- Built and coordinated large-scale digital systems with millions of daily users
- Designed workflows, backend logic, and operational pipelines across Web2 and Web3 systems
- Bridged technical and non-technical teams with calm, human-first communication

### How I Work

- Builder first, researcher second
- Quiet execution over visibility
- Documentation and clarity over hype
- Empathy under pressure
- Systems that support people, not extract from them
