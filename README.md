## Independent AI Safety Researcher | Red Team Operator | Systems Builder

I work at the intersection of systems design, security analysis, and real-world deployment risk.

**→ [Start Here](https://github.com/ChristopherPatrickKuntz/start-here)** — Who I am, how I work, and why.

### Current Focus

Identifying structural failure modes in language-based AI systems, especially those that emerge during real interaction rather than scripted evaluation.

- Premature intent resolution and confidence laundering
- Pre-articulation observability limits
- Probabilistic identity and contestability gaps
- Deployment risk in child-facing and safety-critical contexts

### Background

Before focusing on independent research, I spent years designing and operating real systems in production environments:

- Led operational teams in safety-critical infrastructure
- Built systems handling millions of daily users
- Designed custody models, incentive systems, and abuse-resistant architectures
- Performed post-incident forensic analysis when systems failed

---

### How I Work

- Exploratory first, disciplined second
- Anomaly sensing before formal diagnosis
- Documentation and reproducibility over hype
- Systems evaluated as deployed artifacts, not just models
